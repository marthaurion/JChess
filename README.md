JChess
=======

A Java-based chess program I'm creating.
Initially, this was my own side project, but then I used it for a final assignment in school.
After turning in the assignment, I decided to remove some of the things I created so that I can make this my own way.

Things that are done:
- Can tell when the king is in check
- Created attack maps for checking threatened squares
- Move list displays each move that has been played

Things to be done:
- Chess pieces should be images.
- Checkmate detection
- Add online aspect back.
- Create an AI.
